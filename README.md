# ESP8266 4-Way Pushbutton Dimmer Switch

This is a sketch that uses 4 pushbuttons, to interact as pushbutton, switch or dimmer over mqtt.
It is based on [homie convention](marvinroger/homie) and uses the [homie-esp8266](marvinroger/homie-esp8266) framework.

## Hardware

### Pinout Information (Wemos D1 Mini)

Please be aware that only pin D3 and D4 have an integrated Pull up resistor.
For the other pins of your choice, you will have to add a 10kÎ© pullup resistor to each input.

Also keep in mind that pin D3 is able to reset your device.
Make sure that `Homie.disableResetTrigger();` is called in the `setup()` function befor `Homie.setup()` is called.

## Pushbutton to dimmer handling

### Compare dimmer to pushbutton input

Caution.The following paragraph could be a bit *geeky*.

After some *practical research* the average time for one **button push to button release event** is about `247,4285714ms`.
Minimum time needed was `191ms`.
Maximum time needed was `287ms`.

Based on this values, i have set the `DIMMER_PUSH_INTERVAL` to `300ms` for now.
This value is used to decide wether a push is hold to start a dimmer or just tapped to update the `switchState`.
